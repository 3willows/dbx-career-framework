A rewarding career often includes vertical and lateral growth. Career growth enables a variety of experiences and new capability development. Think of it like a rock climbing wall where you have to move side to side or up and down in order to get closer to the top.

Dropbox measures the success of its Dropboxers largely on business impact. Impact can best be summed up by our core value, They Win, We Win.
 
Impact starts and ends with better serving our customers, which, in turn, helps Dropbox succeed as a business. Anchor your work first and foremost on creating long-term impact.
 
Next, ground yourself in the expectations for your level and team. For each level, you’ll find a summary of the role’s scope, complexity, and team.

A lot of thought and feedback across the company went into this iteration. Career Frameworks are built to flex as the company grows and changes, however, so the Career Frameworks will be a living document that will reflect Dropbox’s evolution.
