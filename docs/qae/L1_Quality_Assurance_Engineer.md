| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Testing Fluency**    | - I write test cases for a feature that is well-defined (but may not have a formal written spec) and utilizes knowledge of our customers<br>- primarily execute manual ‚Äúblack box‚Äù UI testing<br>- I identify bugs that are obvious/clearly present<br>- My test cases effectively cover positive and negative test cases and include most basic edge cases<br>- My bug reports provide sufficient detail *so that a developer can investigate further*. |
| **Testing Strategy**   | - I plan and execute testing on small to medium sized features of simple to moderate complexity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Quality Assessment** | - I report status to cross-functional partners including a basic understanding of quality risks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
